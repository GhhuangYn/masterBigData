Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently collecting, aggregating and moving large amounts of log data from many different sources to a centralized data store.
The use of Apache Flume is not only restricted to log data aggregation. Since data sources are customizable, Flume can be used to transport massive quantities of event data including but not limited to network traffic data, social-media-generated data, email messages and pretty much any data source possible.
Apache Flume is a top level project at the Apache Software Foundation.
There are currently two release code lines available, versions 0.9.x and 1.x.
Documentation for the 0.9.x track is available at the Flume 0.9.x User Guide.
This documentation applies to the 1.4.x track.
New and existing users are encouraged to use the 1.x releases so as to leverage the performance improvements and configuration flexibilities available in the latest architecture.
